The names start out as full names, but than move to last names.  This makes complete sense to a human in context.  I can't get a machine to understand context though.  Thankfully this type of format is rare and \"SREENIVASAN\" is a rare name so I can map it to \"HARI SREENIVASAN\".  \"RUBIN\" is probably a more common name and less popular on PBS newshour so unfortunately there's nothing I can easily do."

U.S. officials say he and Chinese President Xi Jinping traded arguments over China’s new air defense zone around islands that Japan also claims.

The editorial went on to say — quote — “Despite trying to present the image of being an impartial mediator, Washington has obviously taken Japan’s side.” The European Commission has imposed fines of $2.3 billion on major U.S. and European banks over rigging interest rates. Today’s announcement named J.P. Morgan, Citigroup and HSBC, among others. They were accused of manipulating European and Japanese benchmark rates between 2005 and 2010. The rates affect everything from mortgages to credit card bills. Here in the U.S., a bitter cold and snow front pushed across the Rocky Mountains today. Extremely low temperatures dotted the landscape and, with wind chills, could reach 30 degrees below zero in parts of Montana. The storm has spread snow across the region, causing treacherous driving conditions that were blamed for at least six deaths. Another storm is close on the heels of this one, expected later in the week. The pace of enrollment on the healthcare.gov website is improving some. It was widely reported today that 29,000 people signed up Sunday and Monday, the first two days after the mistake-prone site was relaunched. That tops the total for the entire month of October.

Nine-one-one phone calls from Sandy Hook Elementary School during last year’s mass shooting were made public today. The seven recordings revealed police dispatchers in Newtown, Connecticut, urging callers to take cover, even as gunfire echoed. Twenty children and six educators were shot to death by 20-year-old Adam Lanza. A judge ordered the audio material released under the state’s freedom of information law. The suspected gunman in the deadly shooting at Los Angeles International Airport has made his first court appearance. Paul Ciancia entered no plea today to charges he killed an airport security officer and wounded three other people last month. He was denied bail. The 23-year-old suspect was wounded by police during the attack. In economic news, a survey of leading corporate chief executives found they’re more optimistic and plan to increase hiring. At the same time, growth at service sector companies last month was the weakest since June. The conflicting data left Wall Street looking for direction. The Dow Jones industrial average lost almost 25 points to close at 15,889. The Nasdaq rose a fraction of a point to close at 4,038. There’s word today that the great majority of American silent films are now gone forever. The Library of Congress reported that 70 percent of the 11,000 feature-length movies have been lost or destroyed. Only 14 percent still exist in their original format. That’s due in part to the nitrate film stock, which was especially vulnerable to decay and fire.  \n",

      "    It’s exactly what’s happening to Democrats in state after state. As with George W. Bush back in 2006, the president’s unpopularity – he’s barely above 40 percent nationally and well below that in key senate battlegrounds – is proving to be a very heavy burden. In Alaska, Senator Mark Begich – son of a congressman – is being hammered by Dan Sullivan for his votes supporting President Obama. In Colorado, Senator Mark Udall – son of a congressman, nephew of an interior secretary – is trailing Cory Gardner in the polls. In Arkansas, Senator Mark Pryor – whose father was governor and senator – is struggling against Congressman Tom Cotton. What links these campaigns is the same question  Can the family ties of these incumbents help define them as local champions, rather than as allies of an unpopular president? They also point to a striking fact about American political life. To a remarkable extent, it is and always has been a family business. It’s not just these endangered Democratic incumbents. Andrew Cuomo, cruising to a second term as New York’s governor, is the son of a former governor. So is California’s Jerry Brown, heading for a comfortable re-election 56 years after his dad Pat first won the job. Shelley Moore Capito, the likely next Republican senator from West Virginia, is the daughter of ex-governor Arch Moore. Georgia’s Michelle Nunn, daughter of ex-Senator Sam Nunn, is fighting for a senate seat against David Perdue, cousin of a former governor. While Jason Carter, grandson of the ex-president, is in a close race to be that state’s next governor. All told, at least three dozen members of Congress have had family members who’ve held political office before them. This may seem at odds with one of America’s founding ideas. The United States was born in part in rebellion against family privilege; our Constitution forbids titles of nobility, but in fact, America has had a class of political nobility almost from the beginning. From the Adams, to the Harrisons, to the Roosevelts of New York, to the Tafts of Ohio, to the Longs of Louisiana, to the Kennedys of Massachusetts, to the Bushes of Connecticut, Texas and Florida. One generation of politicians seems to beget another. Maybe, says Moon Landrieu, it’s simply like any other business.\n",

      "    Well, I think it’s not too different from that of any profession. I’m not trying to raise politics to a profession, but if you’re a doctor or dentist or a lawyer, your kids mostly incline that way.

The family name is something of a brand name, and it really helps you in the electoral process to have the name Kennedy, to now have the name Clinton, to have the name Bush.\n",

As chair of the Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee, she says, she can do more to protect Louisiana’s critical oil and gas industries.

It’s who can fight for you even when you know with a president who may not be as broadly popular, even when Katrina hits, even when Rita hits, even when the right-wing Tea Party comes at you and wants to tear the government down. So I feel very, you know, yes, it would be wonderful to have you know a party and a president that was more popular but this is not my toughest race.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m JEFF GREENFIELD: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    There is one distinctive Louisiana twist to this campaign that could prove highly significant. Alone among the 50 states what Louisiana will hold on November 4th is actually a primary – an open so called jungle primary in which every senate candidate regardless of party appears on the same ballot. If no one gets 50 percent then the top two finishers compete in a December 6th runoff. And a runoff is all but certain. Retired Air Force Colonel Rob Maness – running as another Republican in the race – is likely to get close to 10 percent of the vote, which means that it would take a month to find out who is Louisiana’s next senator and maybe who controls the United States Senate. Meanwhile ex-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush – son of one president, brother of another – mulls a possible presidential bid of his own, as his son George P. Bush heads toward likely election as Texas Land Commissioner. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul – son of a former Texas congressman – is also eyeing the White House as is the spouse of another former president. And Robert Kennedy’s 34-year-old grandson Joseph Kennedy III is on his way to another term in the U.S. House. So whatever the fate of Landrieu and the other embattled second generation Democratic incumbents, the family business of American politics is very much alive and well.\n",
