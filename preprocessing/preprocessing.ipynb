PBS is not considerate of robots as this [example](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-considering-sending-troops-afghanistan) shows.  The names start out as full names, but than move to last names.  This makes complete sense to a human in context.  I can't get a machine to understand context though.  Thankfully this type of format is rare and \"SREENIVASAN\" is a rare name so I can map it to \"HARI SREENIVASAN\".  \"RUBIN\" is probably a more common name and less popular on PBS newshour so unfortunately there's nothing I can easily do."

      "    For more on the fight between Donald Trump and the Khan family, his recent comments on Russia’s intervention in Ukraine, and Hillary Clinton’s weekend outreach to Rust Belt voters, it’s time for Politics Monday with Tamara Keith of NPR and Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report. You just heard Ghazala Khan say to Judy in response to the questions about Donald Trump’s feud, whatever it is, that, “I can take it.” We have heard in the last few moments Warren Buffett on behalf of Hillary Clinton say, have you no decency, sir? You have made no sacrifice. We heard John McCain also scold, but not withdraw his endorsement today of Donald Trump. I wonder, starting with you, Amy, whether it’s ever a good thing to have to defend yourself by tweet?\n",

The traditional candidate response to a speech like Mr. Khan gave would be to say, my condolences for your loss. Here is my differences of opinion on the policy of it, right? I differed with Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration on the war on terror. I differed with President Bush on going to Iraq in the very first place, even though he did say he supported it early on, when he invaded Iraq. But that is the answer that a traditional politician would give. And, Gwen, I just feel I should just come out here with a tape recorder and just every week say, nothing that he does is like a traditional politician would ever do. What we are seeing is, his supporters, I think, will continue to rally around him, but every day that this campaign is about Donald Trump and his messaging, which is not — which is about him and not about the bigger, broader issues, I don’t think that’s a good day for Donald Trump.\n",

That’s the difference is, in the way Hillary Clinton answered, it ended there. And look at George W. Bush.

Her entire focus — you saw it at the DNC — you are going to see every day for the next 99 days — is to say that he’s temperamentally unfit to be president of the United States, he’s dangerous. And it’s not just going to be one thing or another thing. It’s that this — if this happens day in and day out, this idea about his sympathies, whether it’s his sympathies to Putin, whether it’s his fight that he’s getting in with the Khan family, in the minds of people who are not already in a camp, polarized one way or the other, it sows enough doubt.\n",

On Friday, the news came out, GDP numbers terrible, were at like the second worst recovery since 1949. You’re supposed to go to the Rust Belt and make that case. See, the economy is not doing well under Obama, why would you let Hillary Clinton do it? Of course, that’s not what we were talking about this weekend. We were talking all of these things. What Hillary Clinton was doing this weekend — Tam was on the bus and actually saw this, but if you look at the cities that she went, she went right into Trump country. And that’s not because she thinks she’s going to win there, but campaigns are as much as about winning over voters as it is not losing by a lot. And she’s trying to narrow the margins.

Week after week, the big hits keep attracting big TV audiences to professional and college football. But concerns over head injuries in football and other sports have also continued about a connection between repeated blows and a degenerative brain disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. The latest evidence comes from a new report from BostonUniversity that’s been published in the scientific journal “Brain.” The four-year study examined brain autopsies of 85 male donors ranging from age 17 to 98. It included football players at various levels, boxers, hockey players and a group of veterans. They have found evidence of CTE in 68 cases, almost all of them athletes.

The NFL faces a class-action lawsuit filed last July by thousands of former NFL players and their families, citing lack of disclosure about potential dangers. For more, we’re joined by one of the lead researchers, Dr. Ann McKee, a neurologist and co-director of the center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at BostonUniversity, and Mark Fainaru-Wada, an investigative reporter with ESPN who is working on a documentary about this subject for “Frontline.” Well, Ann McKee, let me start with you. What do you see as the key finding from this study that perhaps we didn’t know before?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m ANN MCKEE: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Well, this study, this disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, has been around since the 1920s. But there have really only been a smattering of reports. In this paper, we more than doubled the world’s experience with this disorder and take it from the very beginning, where it first affects the nervous system, where it affects the nervous system, and then we see it expand progressively in older and older individuals, until it really is a destructive disease that affects most of the brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m JEFFREY BROWN: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    And just to be clear here, the focus is less on the — I guess, the major hits or major concussions, and more on sort of repetition over time?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m ANN MCKEE: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Right. This is exposure to what we call mild traumatic brain injury usually considered almost insignificant hits, not — they don’t even have to rise to the level of concussion. They can be sub-concussion. But when you’re exposed to these hits over a very long period of time, usually many years, you can set yourself up for some long-term consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m JEFFREY BROWN: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    All right, Mark Fainaru-Wada, you have been reporting on some of the — well, there was pushback from some of the experts to these findings. Tell us what you have been hearing from them and from the NFL, for example.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m MARK FAINARUWADA: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Right. Well, my brother and colleague Steve Fainaru and I have been reporting on this for a while for a book and a documentary and for ESPN. And, as Dr. McKee stated, the findings on this are substantial in terms of the numbers. They’re the largest number ever reported. And what we did find, though, was there’s a lot of pushback in the scientific community. Dr. McKee told us about her recent experience at a conference in Zurich where there were various folks who criticized the work. We talked to some of those people, including some of NFL doctors who were there. One NFL member of their brain committee said, you know, relating these cases, creating a causal link based on these case studies to football is akin to saying basically all the ankle injuries suffered by football players wearing Nike shoes were because of the shoes. The argument there is that — and, as Dr. McKee has acknowledged — the data set they’re working from is skewed because it’s based on a series of brains from athletes and players who were showing signs before death in large cases of having mental issues. And so the question that everybody is trying to figure out is, what is the actual incidence of this disease in looking at brains that were healthy vs. players who actually were exposed to football?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m JEFFREY BROWN: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Well, let me ask you, Dr. McKee, to comment on that. How definitive is this? What else do you need to look at to know especially things like how to treat people?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m ANN MCKEE: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Well, this study is definitive in describing and defining what the disease is and how it affects the nervous system. But a key question remains, what’s the incidence and prevalence? How common is this disorder? And that, we will never establish from an autopsy study. For that, we really need to be able to identify this disease in living individuals. And that’s a huge focus of our more recent research. How can we identify this in people that are living? And that might be through MRI scans or PET scans and especially the ones that might peg the TAL protein that develops. It might be seen through blood tests or tests of your urine or CSF. But we are really going to need those tests to be able to determine if a living person has this disease and then be able to measure that person’s exposure to head trauma. And that will be the defining moment. And that will probably take a longitudinal prospective study involving probably thousands of subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m JEFFREY BROWN: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Well, so, Mark Fainaru-Wada, how are professional leagues, people who work with students, student athletes, how are they taking this? How should parents take this in terms of the stakes here, the implications for when people should be in contact sports?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m MARK FAINARUWADA: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Well, I think the numbers what are strike most people. And I think those are the questions that raise issues for some of the leagues and how they deal with it and how significant this is. The study talks about, out of 34 NFL players studied, 33 of them ended up having CTE. And so I think that obviously creates questions. Some people have suggested that the numbers raise more alarming questions than are real. But the league for its part, the NFL, which faces the most scrutiny on this issue, with, as your piece noted, 4,000 former players suing the league right now, the league has looked at the changed rules to address the issue of these sort of larger hits that we have seen, these sort of defining hits. I think the larger question, though, as Dr. McKee touched on earlier, is the subconcussive blows, there’s increasing research around that; 40 percent of the cases of CTE they identified in NFL players were lineman. And so that raises questions about, is just the definitive — the nature of repetitive hits in the game something that exposes a player? And I think that’s what the leagues and parents are trying to figure out as they try to find out how significant an issue is this and what the risk is for their kids.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m JEFFREY BROWN: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Well, Dr. McKee, how far would you go at this point in terms of what you say to parents or athletic directors or professional teams about taking the findings and using them somehow?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m ANN MCKEE: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Well, I think the major caution I would have is that all parents, coaches should take every head injury seriously and try to eliminate the minor hits or the hits to the head as much as possible in any sport. We have already seen in the last four or five years a tremendous focus on concussions. It used to be considered a fairly trivial injury that no one needed to sit out for. And now we’re taking it seriously and we’re resting those athletes and making sure they’re completely asymptomatic until they return to play. And I think this has been a tremendous development. And it will probably go a long way in terms of preventing the development of these long-term consequences in these individuals. At this point, we don’t have any evidence, there’s no available evidence that a single isolated or a few isolated concussions that are well-managed — that means well-rested, the individual is asymptomatic before he goes back to play — there’s no evidence that those injuries lead to this disease. The injuries that seem to lead to this disease are years and years of exposure to many hits. And those hits may be relatively mild.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m JEFFREY BROWN: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    And, Mark, let me just ask you very briefly. You mentioned that lawsuit. Just tell us briefly where do things stand? That goes on, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m MARK FAINARUWADA: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Yes, it’s ongoing. And the current state is that both sides are arguing. The NFL has argued for dismissal of the case. It’s before a federal judge in Philadelphia. I think both sides expect some ruling on whether the case will get tossed out or not in the spring. And, surely, there will be an appeal, one would expect, either way. So I think one expects the lawsuits are going to drag on well into next year at least.\n",

As Nick Schifrin reports, Putin used the occasion to show off new weapons that he says can defeat U.S. missile defenses and maintain a deadly balance with the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m NICK SCHIFRIN: \u001b[0m\n",

      "    He showed off animations of weapons he called invincible, a hypersonic missile apparently capable of crossing continents in seconds, and a never-before-acknowledged nuclear powered cruise missile apparently that can slalom between missile defense systems that Putin considers a long-term threat. It’s not clear the weapons even exist. But Putin said he wasn’t bluffing.\n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m NICK SCHIFRIN: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Putin’s return to Cold War rhetoric comes one month after the U.S. announced its own plans to deploy new nuclear weapons, and greater willingness to use nuclear weapons. Putin said he was responding to American threats.\n",

      "\u001b[4m VLADIMIR PUTIN: \u001b[0m\n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m NICK SCHIFRIN: \u001b[0m\n",

      "\u001b[4m NICK SCHIFRIN: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    The speech took place just over two weeks before the Russian elections. Putin framed the U.S. as an adversary and himself the only leader strong enough to meet the challenge. We turn now to Richard Burt. He was the chief U.S. arms control negotiator during the strategic arms reduction talks with the Soviet Union during the Reagan administration. He also served as assistant secretary of state for European affairs. He’s now at McLarty Associates, an international business consulting firm. Richard Burt, thank you very much.\n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m RICHARD BURT: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Well, part of it is certainly about politics. I mean, there is an election in March. Nobody’s going to beat Vladimir Putin, but Putin wants to get a good chunk, 70 percent or more, of the vote, and he can’t talk about an economy that’s rapidly growing. He doesn’t have the kind of consumer economy that dominated the early part of the century. People’s living standards are actually falling. So, he’s playing the great power card. He’s saying, I brought Russia back, we’re a global superpower, and our technology is first-class, it can compete effectively with the United States, and so you can rest easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m NICK SCHIFRIN: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    That I am the only one who can take on the United States. So, let’s look at it from his perspective for a second. He says, look, you withdraw from the ABM Treaty, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treat. you’re creating missile defenses that can counter our nuclear weapons, and so we have to counter back. What’s wrong with that?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m RICHARD BURT: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Well, Putin is not entirely wrong. We did withdraw from the ABM Treaty in 2002. I personally think that was a mistake, because the Russians tend on these kinds of issues to be paranoid. And the one thing the Russians liked about the ABM Treaty is that it give them the sense that both sides were vulnerable to annihilation. There was a kind of — we called it mutual assured destruction at the time, and so it made the Soviets feel that — and the Russians later that they were co-equal nuclear powers. They were afraid, when the ABM Treaty was abandoned, that the United States would use its superior technology to be able to engage in a potential nuclear first strike, and that we could then politically dominate them. And so they have been concerned about that. And that paranoia coupled with, I think, Putin’s desire to look strong has led to a fairly significant nuclear buildup.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m NICK SCHIFRIN: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    So, there is that buildup happening in Russia. I should say that the United States has also talked about a buildup or modernization of its nuclear weapons. So, do you fear an arms race right now? Do you fear the erosion of arms control?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m RICHARD BURT: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Well, I fear both of those. We are entering a new arms race, for sure. It reminds me of the 1970s, 1980s. What is interesting is, I don’t think Americans are that focused on this at this point, but it’s not only the Russians that are modernizing their forces, with some very capable weapons they know how to build and maybe some fictional weapons we don’t know whether they will build or not. But the Russians are clearly deciding that they want — see nuclear weapons as an important element in their policy. The Trump administration is going doing the same. In fact, even under Barack Obama, the United States decided to engage in a $100 billion — 100 — sorry — $1 trillion-plus nuclear buildup with new missile submarines, new intercontinental-range ballistic missiles, new strategic bombers. So we’re kind of sleepwalking into this new arms race. I don’t think that either side in the near term is going to gain some important advantage, but under these conditions, we could lead to a situation where one or the other side felt that, in a crisis, a serious disagreement, that the other was going to strike, and that that’s when, you know, people begin to make mistakes. They make miscalculations. And the problem, secondly, is, we don’t have any arms control negotiations under way. And we have an important treaty, the INF Treaty signed in 1987, which could collapse over the next year because we believe the Russians are cheating, and they claim we are not following the treaty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m NICK SCHIFRIN: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Quickly, should the U.S. be concerned about this? Should Americans be concerned about these new weapons or should Americans also be concerned about what you call this sleepwalking into a conflict?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m RICHARD BURT: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    I think it’s more of the sleepwalking problem. I think what we need to do is find a way to get back into a serious conversation with the Russians on controlling nuclear weapons. The longer we wait, the more difficult it will be, not only because both sides will have better weapons, but with these new technologies of the sort that Putin talked about today, it’s going to be a lot harder to design effective agreements to control this new arms race.\n",

      "    The report cites incidents dating back to 2010, 37 people shot by police, 23 of them fatally. The most recent occurred just last month and was caught on videotape: the fatal shooting of James Boyd, a 38-year-old homeless man with a history of mental illness. That led to a violent street protest against alleged police brutality. Gene Grant is host of “New Mexico in Focus” on New Mexico Public Television. He has been covering this story and joins us tonight from Albuquerque. Well, Gene, the Justice Department cited a pattern of excessive force, so they’re seeing something that links all these shootings, right? Explain that.\n",

      "\u001b[4m GENE GRANT: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    It’s interesting. As you mentioned, there were 37 incidents, 23 of them fatal. And what they were looking for, quite specifically, if there was an unconstitutional pattern of Fourth Amendment rights being violated here. And they were quite strong in their opening statement right off the bat of the hearing this morning that, in fact, their findings did find, in fact, that the Albuquerque Police Department had a number of situations that they found unconstitutional and did violate those rights. And what that actually did was opened up a lot of dialogue about, well, what is going on here? What is the pattern? And the big problem out here for us with the situation is folks who are mentally ill or in some crisis of some sort. And what the DOJ found was, especially in those cases, APD is coming up short. There is excessive use of force, sometimes deadly, but they mentioned also using Tasers. They were not — not pleased with that part of it as well, as part of a pattern. Not just deadly force, but excessive force was very much part of the situation. They laid out a whole criteria of changes they would like to see. They made it quite clear they intend to stay around the DOJ for a bit and work with APD and the city of Albuquerque and Mayor Richard Berry on some of the reforms. However, what we don’t have at this point and what is apparently being discussed tonight between DOJ and the administration and the Albuquerque Police Department is taking it that next step, with a possible consent degree or a possible federal monitor that would be on hand for a period of time.\n",

      "\u001b[4m GENE GRANT: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    That’s a great question. You know, it’s interesting. We have a new chief, Chief Gordon Eden. He came to replace Ray Schultz, where a lot of these shootings happened under his watch, under Ray Schultz. In that time, Jeffrey, what happened was the use of lapel cameras became part of the reform back a year-and-a-half ago, two years ago. And that is in fact what happened in this James Boyd case, as you know, where it went global. The video just took it to a whole new level. Now, the reaction from the police has been fairly muted so far, but until this point today, there’s been a bit of a circling of the wagons. There’s been a bit of everything is OK here, going back a year-and-a-half, two years ago or so. I think the police department now just basically has its hands tied. They know the community is not going to accept the status quo anymore. We have had three protest marches, one of which made the news globally. I went to the first march, the peaceful march last Tuesday, an enormous march by Albuquerque standards. People have pretty much had it. So, for the police department, it’s a difficulty. They really don’t have anything left to say now that the Department of Justice has had its say on the constitutionality of these issues.\n",

However, he also said three weeks ago that he would prefer and ask for a federal monitor for the situation. He actually came right out without being pressured to do so. So what does that mean in these negotiations with the DOJ? We don’t know. Is it going to be something in between? The big question is, what will the community accept, Jeffrey? You know, for a lot of folks here, there is going to be nothing less than a complete takeover, which nobody thinks is going to happen, won’t be enough. But something has to happen where folks feel like the police department is not correcting itself. We have been through that for 20 years now, and now it’s time for something else.

These were single women, families, people with strollers, couples, elderly, a lot of elders. I saw a lot of elders. And they were just very upset with the whole situation, just saying, look, enough is enough. We’re — this is going to be stop. It is an enormous thing. It’s dominating the news here. It’s dominating the blogs. It’s certainly dominating talk radio and talk shows. You go around town, everybody has got an opinion. It’s amazing the amount of cross-section, by the way, on that point of folks who are not pleased with APD right now. I’m talking a lot of folks who would be naturally inclined to support the police department are now saying to themselves, OK, wait a minute, we need — we have got a problem here. You can’t have 23 deaths, you know, and most of them, a lot of them mentally ill, and not have a problem. So everyone is looking for a solution here. It’s an economic development issue.
