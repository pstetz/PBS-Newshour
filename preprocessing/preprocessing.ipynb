PBS is not considerate of robots as this [example](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-considering-sending-troops-afghanistan) shows.  The names start out as full names, but than move to last names.  This makes complete sense to a human in context.  I can't get a machine to understand context though.  Thankfully this type of format is rare and \"SREENIVASAN\" is a rare name so I can map it to \"HARI SREENIVASAN\".  \"RUBIN\" is probably a more common name and less popular on PBS newshour so unfortunately there's nothing I can easily do."

      "    Much of the national focus on improving health care has centered on the expansion of coverage that’s starting to take effect. But a report out today says it’s time for the country to pay more attention to the socioeconomic conditions that play a role in health outcomes, especially for lower-income Americans. The recommendations, issued by a nonpartisan commission created by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, call for new investments like pre-k education for children under 5. David Williams is a professor at Harvard’s School of Public Health. He was a staff director for the commission as well. And, for the record, the foundation is one of our sponsors for health coverage. Professor Williams, it’s good to have you with us.\n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m DAVID WILLIAMS: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Well, first, the larger context is, as a nation, we have a huge problem. We spend more money on medical care than any other country in the world. According to the World Bank, half of the money spent on medical care in the world annually is spent in the United States. Yet we rank among — at the bottom of the industrialized world on health and we are losing ground over time. So we have a crisis. And the problem is not just a problem of the low-income individuals and the poor. Even the best-off Americans are not currently achieving a level of health that is possible. And more medical care spending will not solve it. We now need to look at what are the drivers of health in the first place. Our health care system is wonderful. We have great facilities. We have the best-trained medical work force in the world, but to a large degree, medical care is a repair shop that takes care of us once we get sick, and it doesn’t determine whether we get sick or not in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m JUDY WOODRUFF: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    So, what is an example of something that can be done to improve someone’s what we call socioeconomic status, whether it’s education or something else, that then leads to an improvement in health?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m DAVID WILLIAMS: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    So, let’s talk about early childhood development. What we know is that the foundations of health in adulthood are laid in childhood. And the opportunities and the experiences that children have even before they go to school shape their risk of chronic disease 30, 40 years later, so that everything that we can do to prepare those children and give them the optimal health and optimal developmental opportunities in the preschool area, then they’re ready for school, and they have high levels of education, and they will have better health for the rest of their life.\n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m DAVID WILLIAMS: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Certainly, more health education and more physical fitness in school are good, but that is not where I’m going. We’re going on preparing those kids for learning. So, for example, a child exposed to toxic stress — and toxic stress are examples of being taken care of by a caregiver who is chronically depressed, growing up in chronic poverty, being a victim of abuse — that child will have more problems in success in school, but will also have more health problems as an adult. Studies show that we can actually measure the alteration of brain structure in those preschool kids linked to their exposure to toxic stress.\n",

How do you look at the arguments that are out there about this?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m DAVID WILLIAMS: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    I think every child needs the opportunity for healthy development. For many children, they may get that in the home. And they don’t have to go to a preschool setting. So we are not necessarily calling for preschool — universal preschool for all. We are calling for universal preschool for those who are in environments where they need that healthy environment to do well. And that certainly characterizes many of our lower socioeconomic populations.\n",

      "    That is a really good question. Given our expenditure on medical care, this money is not — there isn’t a shortage of money in this country. The question is, how do we spend our money and what are our priorities? But the good news is, there are promising models all across the country right now with creative public-private participations, like in the state of Minnesota, where the business community and the state has come together to provide scholarships so that all poor kids can get a preschool education. Or there’s an example from Texas where the state raised the sales tax by one-eighth of a penny, and that money is allocated for preschool education. So there are wonderful examples.\n",

The best evidence comes from a study done in Ypsilanti, Michigan, more than 50 years ago, the Perry Preschool study, where kids were randomly, by the flip of a coin, received preschool or didn’t receive preschool. They have now been followed for 40 years. Those kids that got the preschool, 40 years later, higher levels of education, higher levels of income, higher levels of home ownership, higher levels of marriage, less involvement with the criminal justice system, less involvement with the social welfare system. And for every dollar invested, there is a $17 return to society from that preschool program. That is stunning. That is amazing economic development that we can achieve.\n",

      "\u001b[4m KERRY EGAN: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    When people learn that I’m a hospice chaplain, they usually have one of two reactions. They either say they could never do that job and change the subject completely, or they have questions, lots of questions. One of the questions I hear more often than I would have thought is about people’s last words. People are enormously curious about what people who are actively dying talk about. Have you ever heard anything really amazing? What’s the craziest deathbed confession you have ever heard? Should I plan out my last words? That last question seemed really odd to me the first time someone asked, but I have been asked it at least a dozen times, so it’s obviously on some people’s minds. The questions don’t actually match up with what typically happens when someone is dying. Instead, I suspect they’re coming from a sort of Hollywood movie or television idea of what dying should be like, clean, calm, bizarrely romantic, always with the good sense to close your eyes before taking a long sigh and limply tossing your head to the side, and beautiful, urgent, life-altering utterances. So, if this is what you think happens in death, I can see how you would feel a lot of pressure to get it right. When someone asks me if they should plan their last words  No. People who are dying are often unconscious for days before they die. Sometimes, they’re in pain. They’re often highly medicated. Honestly, most of the last words I have heard are so mundane, I can’t even give an example. When you know you have a terminal diagnosis, death often takes a person by surprise. You might not even know that your last words are your last words. But there’s a longer, more complex answer too. If you had something so important to tell your loved ones that you feel the need to plan out what to say, then why would you wait to say it? If it’s so important that you’re worried about it now, then say it now. Ask for forgiveness now. Say you love someone now. Share whatever wisdom you have with the world right now. Here’s the thing. When people ask me about dying words, what they’re really asking is, what is so important in this life that it should be the very last thing we talk about? So, instead of asking, what do other people talk about, ask yourself, what do I really want to talk about now? And that’s a really good question. That’s a really good thing to ponder.\n",

      "    The numbers are grim: A female soldier is more likely to be raped by a fellow officer than she is to die in combat. It’s one of many statistics that have fixed new attention on the problem of sexual assault in the armed forces. Pentagon findings last May estimated 26,000 troops were sexually assaulted last year, but only 3,400 attacks were reported. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York is leading an effort to change the way the military handles these cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    So, today we’re standing in a united front to take on these issues with new legislation that will fundamentally remove the decision-making from the chain of command and give that discretion to an experienced military prosecutor, where it belongs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m JUDY WOODRUFF: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Gillibrand points to victims who complain that too often commanders ignore their allegations or their careers suffer. But her proposal was defeated by the Senate Armed Services Committee in June in favor of an alternative by committee Chair Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan. It requires automatic review of any commander’s decision not to prosecute a sexual assault case. Last week, Levin released two letters from senior military officials supporting his argument that prosecution should remain within the chain of command. Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill agrees with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m CLAIRE MCCASKILL: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    We believe there will be more prosecutions, and the numbers support that. We believe that the only way to hold command accountable is to make them responsible, not to completely remove their responsibility. We believe that’s a recipe for disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m JUDY WOODRUFF: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Still, Gillibrand is undaunted. She says she hopes to take her measure to the full Senate. Already, she has 44 supporters from both parties. The legislation could be brought to the floor as early as September. And joining us from Capitol Hill to talk about her proposal and its prospects going forward is New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Welcome to the NewsHour Senator. First of all, tell us why it’s so important to you that the prosecution of sexual assault charges be taken out of the chain of military command.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Because it’s exactly what the victims have asked for. They have said over and over again that they don’t trust the chain of command to deliver justice in their cases. For those victims who have been courageous enough to report these cases, 62 percent have said they have been retaliated against for reporting those cases. Of the tens of thousands who didn’t report incidents of sexual assault, rape, and unwanted sexual assault contact, the reason they give us is they don’t trust the chain of command, that they think nothing will be done, or that they fear retaliation, or they have seen someone else be retaliated against. So what we’re looking for is a way to address these cases in a more objective way, where a trained military prosecutor becomes the decision-maker as to whether or not these cases should go to trial. And hopefully with that objectivity and lack of bias, more victims will feel confident in coming forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m JUDY WOODRUFF: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Senator, as you know, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, your fellow Democrat, Carl Levin, is arguing something very different. He says it could take responsibility away from the commanders, relieve them of the kind of incentive they should feel. He argues that you should leave it with them and, when they don’t prosecute a case, it should go to a superior officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    My response is quite simple. They are still responsible for these cases. They’re 100 percent responsible to make sure no one is raped or sexually assaulted within the military. They are still responsible that no one is retaliated against, and that they can set a command climate that’s consistent with victims being able to come forward and report these cases. The chain of command is entirely on the hook for good order and discipline. And, frankly, Judy, if you’re having 26,000 sexual assaults, rapes, and unwanted sexual contacts a year, you’re not maintaining good order and discipline. And if those few victims that do come forward, 62 percent are being retaliated against, you’re not setting a command climate that’s conducive for victims receiving justice. So I don’t believe commanders are off the hook. I think they’re entirely on the hook to do a better job than they’re doing today and to have that legal decision, which is just a legal decision, where evidence is weighed, being made by someone who is trained to do that. Commanders are still 100 percent responsible for making sure these crimes don’t happen and making sure that there’s no retaliation for a victim when they come forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m JUDY WOODRUFF: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    I was just going to say, Chairman Levin, again, his argument then is that what he wants to do is make it a crime if there’s a retaliation against a victim.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    And I agree. And we have already voted on that. We are 100 percent in agreement, and consensus has already been reached on that. We have passed that measure out of the Armed Services Committee unanimously. So now retaliation is going to be a crime, and it is a crime under the jurisdiction of commanders. And they are 100 percent responsible for making sure it doesn’t happen and, if it does, that it can be reported and that justice can be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m JUDY WOODRUFF: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Senator, what do you think it says about this issue that in order to put together a coalition of support, you have had to reach way beyond your own party? You have reached into the Republican Party to people who you would typically disagree with politically, Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Rand Paul? And, meanwhile, you are fighting opposing fellow Democrats like Senator Levin, Senator McCaskill and a number of others?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Well, we all agree that we have to do something about sexual assault and rape within the military. And victims aren’t Democrats or Republicans. They don’t have an ideology. Victims’ voices have to be heard. And that’s why you’re hearing from senators across the political spectrum who say the status quo is unacceptable, we have to do something. And they’re listening to those victims when they say they don’t trust the chain of command to bring justice in these cases and that the current command climate is untenable for them. The secretaries of defense since Dick Cheney was secretary of defense some 20-odd years ago have said, Judy, over and over again zero tolerance for sexual assaults and rape. This has been within the chain of command every one of those years since. The commanders have had every bit of authority they need to tackle this problem and solve this problem, but it’s not being solved. So I think that measure of transparency and accountability and objectivity makes sense. And I don’t think, as they say, it will undermine good order and discipline because we have allies that we fight side by side with, the U.K., Israel, Canada, who have done this already and they still have good order and discipline within their ranks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m JUDY WOODRUFF: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Two other quick questions. Of course, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has not gone along with your approach. Where does President Obama stand? Have you talked to him about this?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    I have not been able to speak to him directly, although I have asked for that conversation. I’m hopeful that President Obama will support this change, this reform, this commonsense reform that creates that transparency and accountability. I also hope Secretary Hagel will. Secretary Hagel has already made the bold decision that taking the decision of whether or not to overturn a jury verdict out of the chain of command. Now, he’s already changed and recommended a change to the Uniform Code of Military Justice to say this one legal decision should be taken out of the chain of command. I think we should add a second legal decision, whether or not to go to trial, and also take that out of the chain of command.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m JUDY WOODRUFF: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    So, just quickly, right now, you have 44 supporters among your fellow senators. Do you think you will get a majority?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    I do. And I think that the more time we have so that I can — and my allies and colleagues, we have so many senators who support this reform. The more time we have to talk to our colleagues, to explain the facts, what’s actually happening, the fact that there’s 26,000 cases, but only 3,300 being reported, the fact that only one in 10 go to trial, those statistics are highly concerning. And when they hear that and they hear what the victims tell us, it causes them very grave concern. And that’s how we have slowly won the support that we have.\n",
