This week, the head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced his resignation, and news reports suggest that battles within the commission over safety requirements may partially account for his departure.

Since the Three Mile Island meltdown in 1979, this has been part of the routine at all U.S. nuclear power plants, one of many changes in the way the industry does business in the wake of that accident. But now, in the wake of the Fukushima meltdowns, U.S. regulators and the industry are grappling with how best to respond, or not, to what happened in Japan. Gregory Jaczko is the outgoing chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n",

      "\u001b[4m GREGORY JACZKO: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Nuclear power plants generally work well when a lot of things aren’t changing. So there is, I think, an inertia against change and against improvement. And I think it’s something we have to be vigilant about and continue to push, as the regulator, to make sure that that change happens.\n",

In industry parlance, it is called defense in depth. These portable generators at River Bend are the last line in that defense if a failure, a disaster, or terrorism knocks out the three larger backup generators designed to keep the cooling water flowing and the nuclear fuel from melting. But industry watchdogs warn there are holes in the defense at U.S. nuclear power plants.\n",

It documents 15 near-misses, many occurring because reactor owners either tolerated known safety problems or took inadequate measures to correct them; problems with safety-related equipment that increased the risk of damage to the nuclear core; recognized, but unresolved problems that often cause significant safety-related events at nuclear power plants or increase their severity. And it says NRC inspectors all too often focus just on a specific problem, not its underlying cause.\n",

The 40-year licenses to operate the reactors here are up for renewal. Indian Point’s owner, Entergy, is seeking a 20-year license renewal. But where to set the safety bar, especially after Fukushima, is at the heart of a raging debate over whether Indian Point should get a new lease on life. Eric Schneiderman is the attorney general of the state of New York.\n",

      "    After Three Mile Island , a federal court ruling forced utilities to expand their list of what-if scenarios and consider the cost of protecting against more unlikely events than required by the NRC. They are called severe accident mitigation alternative analyses, or SAMAs.\n",

      "\u001b[4m ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN: \u001b[0m\n",

They include adding a diesel generator to charge batteries, a flood alarm, better flood protection, additional devices to monitor for leaks, and a valve to reduce the risk of hydrogen explosions. In all, the upgrades carry a $77 million price tag. But, surprisingly, implementation of SAMA upgrades like these wasn’t a prerequisite for an NRC license renewal. Why not?\n",

The second part is about the federal government needing to do a review to look at environmental consequences. So, it’s as part of that — that second review that we look at these severe accident issues, and they really are about looking at environmental impacts.\n",

      "\u001b[4m MILES O’BRIEN: \u001b[0m\n",

These are cheap remedies that yield a substantial safety, big bang for the buck, or little bang for the buck, I guess. But it’s something that they should absolutely be required to do. And now, in the context of Indian Point, because it will be a condition of their relicensing, they will be required to going forward.

In fact, the announcement of his resignation comes amid a battle with other commissioners over whether to embrace a menu of a dozen changes proposed by a task force that studied the Fukushima meltdowns. Among the recommendations? A requirement that plants have vents designed to prevent buildup of explosive gas, that operators plan for outages at more than one reactor simultaneously, and, most important, the installation of extra generators like this one at River Bend that would allow a nuclear plant to endure a long blackout of at least eight hours without losing the ability to keep cooling water flowing over the hot nuclear fuel rods.\n",

Jeff, so, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton and President Obama have all struck a gracious tone.  The idea is to make a smooth transition.  But this was an ugly campaign season and it seems like passion is taking a little bit of a break.  Do you think it’s going to be these passions and ugliness will bubble up again?\n",

      "\u001b[4m JEFF GREENFIELD: \u001b[0m\n",
      "     Well, it’s hard to say. You’re right.  Donald Trump, President Obama and Hillary Clinton for that matter had gracious statements. On the other hand, the outgoing Democratic Senate leader, Harry Reid, saying of Trump, called him “a sexual predator who lost the popular vote and fueled his campaign with bigotry and hate.”  Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s campaign manager, already said there might be a lawsuit at that one.  You have Omarosa, Trump’s reality show companion, saying that there’s an enemies list that they have. And it’s also interesting to me that the transition may get ugly or even within the Republican Party, because of some hard feelings.  Trump has reached out to Speaker Paul Ryan, but you have ex-speaker, Newt Gingrich, saying about the Republicans who didn’t back Trump, he called them “whiney, sniveling negative cowards who should be consigned to the ashbin of history.” So, there are some pretty hard feelings not just between Republicans and Democrats, but even among Republicans that I’m not sure have quite called down yet.\n",

      "     The transition is the first clue we really get about what kind of administration a new president wants to bring, and there’s always tension, always, between the campaign and the seasoned insiders of either party in Washington who are looking to play a role.  That is particularly true in this case because Trump’s campaign was so much of an insurgent campaign, and so, ended both parties’ corruption.\n",

      "     Well, but remember, when you hear that they now have control of all of the branches of government and presumably soon will have the Supreme Court in the political sense, the question is, what agenda’s going to be pushed? Yes, there are clearly going to be big tax cuts, most of which will go to the more affluent.  They will be some kind of dismantling of Obamacare, but is it going to be a wholesale dismantling, or are they going to try to keep some of the more attractive elements of it?  If Trump means to launch a huge infrastructure program, and embrace tax cuts, that’s got to mean an explosion of the deficit, but the Republican Party in Congress is not particularly fond of deficits.  So, even though they have control, they’ve got to figure out who is really speaking for Republican Party.\n",

They lost 11 Senate seats.  They lost upwards of 60 House seats.  They control state government in six states, the Republicans control it in 24.  The Republicans have I think two-thirds of the governorships and Democrats have lost 900 legislative seats. So, it has been a terrible eight years for Democratic Party.  And the only hope they can have is, well, you know, the midterms usually bring bad news for the party in power.  But you look at the map and realize that Democratic senators will be up in the reddest states in the country.  So, I’m not sure where, I suppose they’ll take heart from the fact the popular vote by 2 million votes.  But winning the popular and a buck gets you a newspaper.\n",

Is it time for some of the leaders on the left to say to the protesters, peaceful protesters, “Fine, but assaulting officers and damaging property is not”?  Is it time for somebody often the right to say, you know what, we won this election, but there is no time for bigotry we’re seeing and some of the hatred?  Has anybody ever been in a position also, a president-elect or a president to have come out and say, we need to behave better, we need to be civil?\n",
      "GREENFIELD:  I think both those messages would be very helpful.  When — you know, when people are breaking windows in downtown cities because their candidate lost the race and they really don’t like the new president, it’s kind of hard to figure out what message that sends.  And, you know, I think Trump could take a note from Bob Dole, 20 years ago, in his acceptance speech, explicitly said, if there any supporting me, you know, who are bigots, who are racists, there’s the door. But I do point out that when Trump was asked if some of his language he now regrets, he said, “No, I won”, which suggests he regards some of the rhetoric as, you know, transactional.  If it worked, it worked. Think of the fact that he is about to become president of the United States, we could really use a sign from him that he understands that when a president speaks, every word weighs a ton, and there’s got to be a distinction between what some of his supporters embrace and what he really believes.\n",

      "    We return now to our lead story, President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. It has drawn praise and sparked condemnation. One of the critics is Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. He’s a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a supporter of the nuclear deal. We spoke a short time ago, and I began with his overall reaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m TIM KAINE: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Well, William, I was very, very disappointed. This is going the make us less safe. It’s going the raise the risk of unnecessary war in the Middle East. And as a member of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committee, with a kid in the United States Marine Corps, I don’t think we ought to be undermining diplomacy. I think we ought to be strengthening diplomacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m WILLIAM BRANGHAM: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    I mean, the president has argued that there were many problems with this deal, that the sunset provisions allow the restrictions on Iran to go away, that the deal doesn’t address Iran’s development of ballistic missiles, that it doesn’t deal with Iran’s behavior elsewhere in the region. Are those not fair criticisms in your mind?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m TIM KAINE: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    There are fair criticisms of Iran, but those aren’t good criticisms of the deal. The first sentence of the first paragraph of the deal, William, as you know, Iran pledges never to seek to purchase, acquire, or develop nuclear weapons. Why would the U.S. want to blow up that deal and relieve Iran of that obligation? It makes absolutely no sense. And, as you know, the secretary of defense, Secretary Mattis, testified in an open hearing before the Armed Services Committee that the deal was in America’s interest and Iran was complying with the deal. So he is ignoring the advice, not only of our allies, but even of his own secretary of defense, and I just see no percentage in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m WILLIAM BRANGHAM: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    I understand that the deal did have a pledge from Iran never to develop them, but as Prime Minister of Israel Netanyahu showed last week, the Iranians at one point did very actively try to build a nuclear weapons program. And the president argues that they signed this deal in bad faith, that you cannot trust them, so that pledge is meaningless in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m TIM KAINE: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Well, the reason that you do a deal is, if you don’t trust somebody, you want to get inspections. That’s what this deal got us that we never had before. And Iran now doesn’t have to allow the inspections. That was the core of Secretary Mattis’ argument. The deal allowed significant inspections of Iran’s nuclear capacity. Of course, in the past, they were seeking nuclear weapons. That’s why we did the deal to begin. We did it to top their nuclear weapons program. And even the Israeli security officials and Mossad intelligence officials, when I would go to the region and meet with them, they say that Iran has been complying with the deal. We should focus our energy and attention on the things that Iran is doing wrong. We gave the White House sanctions authority nearly a year ago to take stiff action against Iranian violation of missile program rules and violations of human rights provisions. The White House has chosen not to use those sanctions tools. And instead they’re blowing up the one deal that the IAEA, our allies, and our secretary of defense says is actually working.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m WILLIAM BRANGHAM: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    The president argues that he can renegotiate this deal, that Iran is financially weak enough, that these new sanctions will bite, and that he can strike a new deal, a better deal. You don’t seem to think that’s possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m TIM KAINE: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Well, I think it’s going to be difficult, because, here, the reason that sanctions bite is if the global community is with us. But here we have our allies, Germany, France, Britain, urging us to stay in the deal. We have the International Atomic Energy Agency saying that Iran is complying with the deal. The sanctions bite hard if the world is unified, but what the president has now done is driven a wedge between us and our European allies, in the guise of what he would call America first. What he’s really pitching is America alone. And America being alone without allies working hand in hand with us on an issue like this doesn’t make us stronger. It makes us weaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m WILLIAM BRANGHAM: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    As you heard, the president today said that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on his way to North Korea right now to start these — the initial talks for that nuclear deal, potential nuclear deal. Do you believe what the president did today helps or hurts our negotiating position with the North Koreans?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m TIM KAINE: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    I think it hurts our position with the North Koreans. I’m glad we’re having this dialogue. I think dialogue is preferable to not having dialogue. But the message to the North Koreans is this – if you do a deal with the United States, and even if the international community and all the agencies say North Korea is complying with the deal, the U.S. is not a reliable partner and will back out of it. With respect to the Iran deal, we should keep the focus on Iranian behavior and misbehavior. But what the president has done, he’s now turned the focus on America’s good faith in keeping a deal that’s being complied with. And I think that will reduce the likelihood of North Korea feeling confident enough that they could agree to a deal with the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m WILLIAM BRANGHAM: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    Do you have a sense what the Iranians are going to do now? We heard President Rouhani made some comment about how he would like to stay in the deal with the Europeans, perhaps with China and Russia. But there also seemed to be a hint that they might perhaps put in place the ability to start up their program again. What is your sense of what they’re going to do next?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[4m TIM KAINE: \u001b[0m\n",
      "    I don’t — I’m not for sure, but here’s what my gut tells me. I think that they will probably try to work together with the European allies, Russia, and China to continue to comply with some aspects of the deal, so that those nations will help them economically. By doing that, they will effectively drive a wedge between the United States and our European allies, which is a problem. But what I also expect Iran to do is, because the deal involved them agreeing to some very specific and heightened inspections, I think you will see them say, well, President Trump is out of the deal. We don’t have to do the rigorous inspections that the deal required. I think you will start to see them scaling back on allowing inspections, even if they don’t immediately start up activity to develop plutonium or uranium.\n",
