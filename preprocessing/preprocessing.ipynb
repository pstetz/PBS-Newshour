The names start out as full names, but than move to last names.  This makes complete sense to a human in context.  I can't get a machine to understand context though.  Thankfully this type of format is rare and \"SREENIVASAN\" is a rare name so I can map it to \"HARI SREENIVASAN\".  \"RUBIN\" is probably a more common name and less popular on PBS newshour so unfortunately there's nothing I can easily do."

Getting it all back is going to take them at least six months. The battle for Eastern Mosul lasted 100 days, and it cost the Iraqi army at least 500 dead. They want to limit the casualties this side of the river in Western Mosul. And, to that end, they’re using far more ordnance, artillery, and airstrikes, like the one you have just heard. I.S. can also strike from the air. That was a grenade dropped close to us by one of their drones. This propaganda video appears to confirm the commitment of their fighters here in Mosul.

So, can the Islamic State group be destroyed and degraded, as President Obama laid out?  For that, we get three views. Feisal Istrabadi was Iraq’s deputy ambassador to the United Nations from 2004 to 2007. He’s now a professor of international law and diplomacy at Indiana University. Frederic Wehrey is a former U.S. Air Force officer who served in and around the Middle East, including in Iraq. He’s now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. And Hussein Ibish is a senior fellow on the American Task Force on Palestine. He writes extensively on Middle East issues. And we welcome all three of you back to the program.

So, yes, I think you can, because they have — they represent a very small minority of the populations of the countries that they are in the midst of. There is a rising consensus amongst all the countries of the region and the peoples of the region that these people represent a direct threat in the region and internationally. And I think that an appropriate response by the countries of the region in coordination with the United States and NATO allies can result and must result — indeed, we don’t seem to me to have much of a choice — in the defeat of these organizations.\n",

But, as we heard, undercutting this movement’s ideology is going to be a long-term, perhaps even generational process.

And I think it’s maybe more doable to degrade them to the point that they’re a nuisance and a problem in Iraq, I think going after their stronghold in Raqqa, in Syria, where they are really quite dug in and where they are running what amounts to a mini-state that is, as Nabil Elaraby, the head of the Arab League, was just saying in your promo clip there, is a threat to the state system. It’s not a state that wants to join the state system. It’s a state that posits itself as an alternative, not to Syria and Iraq, but to the whole Westphalian state system.

I think most of us realize this may well be our last chance to keep our country together.

In this case, the action of the states, the absence of a market in coal and other energy supplies, failure of the monsoon, these are all contributing factors.

      "    OK, Ray. Well, this is a very important case. The court back in 1976 approved of the way Congress had divided campaign regulation between campaign spending and campaign contributions. It said that spending was something that you really could not regulate, put limits on. It was more closely aligned with pure speech under the First Amendment. And — but campaign contributions, even though they involve speech that was protected, you could regulate that because there was a greater risk of corruption or the appearance of corruption of giving large sums of money directly to a candidate or a political committee. This case is asking the justices whether the total limits on what someone can give in a two-year election cycle violates the First Amendment now. The proponents of this case argue that the risk of corruption is no longer there because of changes in election laws over the years, and it’s time to at least limit the aggregate total amount that can be given, but keep in place the base limits, limits that someone can contribute during one election.\n",

And the result is going to be basically more money in campaigns if the court goes down that road. But limits on contributions, the court has upheld those for almost 40 years now.

      "    Yes, we’re coming back to abortion. Two cases are on the docket. One involves a 35-foot buffer zone around abortion clinics in Massachusetts. Back in 2000, the Supreme Court upheld an eight-foot buffer zone around clinics in Colorado. Here again, those who are challenging the buffer zone are saying, well, if this 35-foot buffer zone doesn’t comport with what you said in the 2000 case, overrule that 2000 case. The second case will be the first time the Supreme Court would look at medication abortions, drugs used to terminate a pregnancy, for example, RU-486. This involves an Oklahoma law. It is in a strange position, because the court asked the Oklahoma Supreme Court to clarify the meaning of the law. It did what we call certified two questions to that court. Oklahoma Supreme Court hasn’t answered yet. So we’re not sure what the court’s going to do when it does get the answers, whether it’s going to go forward with it or not. That state law requires the drugs to be used according to the FDA label. But since the FDA label was approved some seven years ago, I believe it is, science has advanced, and there is now an off-label use.\n",

      "    That’s right. This — this issue goes back to 1983, when that Supreme Court met in that term, upheld legislative prayers in a challenge brought to the Nebraska legislature’s use of prayers at opening sessions. The case before the court now involves the town of Greece, New York, which opens its town board meetings with prayers by local clergies — clergy. The lower federal appellate court found that those prayers were predominantly Christian in nature, and that violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment. So the Supreme Court is going to have to look once again at how much government accommodation of prayer in the public sphere it’s going to allow.\n",

There are some for-profit business owners who have challenged the mandate that they provide health care insurance that includes contraception. They contend that that mandate violates their religious beliefs. And there are two cases involving cell phone searches by police and whether they violate the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.\n",
