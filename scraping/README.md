# PBS Newshour - Web Scraping

Author: Patrick Stetz  [(github)](https://github.com/pstetz/)

### Files

- `transcripts.py`: all the helper functions needed to scrap PBS Newshour's website.  Contains all the magic from writing Beautiful Soup and Multiprocessing code.

- `transcripts.ipynb`: uses the helper functions to download all the transcripts.  This notebook is heavily commented and can be read from a nice high level approach without worrying too much about the details.
